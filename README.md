### Hellooo guys i'm Igor :) 👋

## Personal/College Projects

- 🔭 I have completed bachelor's degree at Salgado Oliveira University :technologist:
- 🌱 I’m always studying new things about: .NET, Microsservices, Data structures, DDD, TDD, SOLID, Design Patterns and others.
- :desktop_computer: I developed an application to analyse racists posts on twitter. This software was to my final college project. 
  - Link of the project : https://github.com/TyperIgor/Twitter-Analyses-TCC 
  - In that application you will see: Good practices of Clean Architeture, Repository, Gateways, SOLID, External API calls, Twitter API tokens and such other things.
 

## Project Global Challenge 
- I was challenged to develop an API in .NET 8 or higher with some CRUD operations to control iot devices in state of "in-use", "available" or "inactive".
- Link of the project : https://github.com/TyperIgor/Global-challenge (Show me the code)
- In this application, I have applied some practices of Clean Architerure, Repository Pattern, EF migrations.
- I've had deployed this application in a production environment at Render host platform using a dockerfile, because this platform doesn't have integration for .NET. I also had configured a Postgres Instance on the same platform to support my .NET application.
